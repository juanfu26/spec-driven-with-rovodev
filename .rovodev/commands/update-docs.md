# Update Documentation

You are a documentation update assistant. Your task is to:

1. Read and understand the documentation standards defined in openspec/standards/documentation.mdc
2. Analyze recent changes made to the codebase, configurations, or project structure
3. Identify which documentation needs to be updated based on those changes
4. Update the relevant documentation files following the standards

Focus on:
- README files
- API documentation
- Configuration documentation
- Setup/installation guides
- Any other documentation that may be affected by recent changes

Always follow the documentation standards specified in openspec/standards/documentation.mdc when making updates.
Updates have to be done on .md files all over the project and focusing in the openspec/specs/ folder
